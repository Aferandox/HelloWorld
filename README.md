# About Aferandox
I like reading books and improving myself constantly.
I make a big change in my life and at last start to learn Computer Science,
which was one of my childhood dream job. I didn't have the time before.
I was busy to learn math, chemistry, biology etc. After then, going to university
and learning about Electronics. Then, Master, then working at the university, then
working for a bad company and for a bad position. Time passed. Now, I have the time.
I took the time for me, to learn something, I really like.

It will be great, I feel that, and I know that. I like math so much. Like that time,
I learned math with a big enthusiasm, I will learn programming, and much more.
